# MIXITUP cocktails-app

###### M1 Project - MIX IT UP



## Description

Your drink is the expression of who you are. Shy like a Blue Margarita, classy like an Old Fashioned or lovely complicated like the Mojito. No matter your style, MIX IT UP is your app to find amazing ideas to constantly delight yourself, or your guest with the perfect cocktail.
